# BinaryTrie
- A router forwarding table look up algorithm using binary tries to store and look up the longest prefix that matches the destination IP.
- Inspired by this video: https://youtu.be/G0IWn5f-B5s?t=763
- Good exercise to remember a little of the trie data structure and try to get used to unit tests :D
- table.txt is the forwarding table with the IP prefixes and the corresponding port.
